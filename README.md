# Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement through Log Analysis using Large Language Models

## Project Description
This project aims to utilize large language models to enhance compliance monitoring and enforcement through log analysis. By leveraging the power of advanced natural language processing techniques, we seek to automate and streamline the process of analyzing logs to ensure compliance with regulations, policies, and standards.

## Key Features
- **Log Analysis**: Utilize large language models to extract meaningful insights from logs.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Automatically identify non-compliant behavior and patterns within logs.
- **Enforcement Mechanisms**: Implement enforcement mechanisms based on the analysis results.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large volumes of log data efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow or PyTorch for large language model implementation
- Log parsing libraries (e.g., Logstash, Fluentd)
- Additional libraries for data preprocessing and analysis
